Here are a few use cases for this project:

1. Road Safety Enforcement: The Helmet Detection model could be used by traffic police or relevant authorities to monitor traffic and identify riders not wearing helmets, therefore enforcing road safety regulations.

2. Construction Site Safety: Companies can use this model to identify any construction workers operating without a helmet on, and therefore ensure adherence to safety protocols.

3. Sports Equipment Tracking: This model could be used to monitor sports like cricket, football, or cycling, to ensure players always have their helmets on during the game.

4. Bike Sharing Services: This model can be utilized in bike sharing services to ensure riders are wearing helmets before they can start their ride; promoting customer safety.

5. Automated Surveillance Systems: A Helmet Detection model can be added to existing surveillance systems, specifically in areas where helmet usage is crucial. It can alert authorities about individuals not observing safety measures by not wearing helmets.
